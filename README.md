## About

This is a rust port of an agent-based model by [Brandon Gower-Winter](https://github.com/BrandonGower-Winter). [The original model](https://github.com/BrandonGower-Winter/NeoCOOP) is described as "An Agent-Based Model simulating the emergence and evolution of altruistic and selfish behaviour in Neolithic Households under varying degrees of environmental stress."

## Visualisation

A visualisation of a simulation is available in the root of the project, called `visual.gif`.
